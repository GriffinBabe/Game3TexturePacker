SpriteSheet generator script using LibGDX's runnable-texturepacker.jar (https://github.com/libgdx/libgdx)

Works only on linux!

[How does it work?]

1. Add in a "in" folder a "n", "s", "e", and "w" folder.
2. Add in those folders your images (png).
3. Add a "out" folder.
4. Run "python script.py".
5. Find your SpriteSheet in the "out" folder.

6. Feel free to change the configuration file "pack.json" (Documentation : https://github.com/libgdx/libgdx/wiki/Texture-packer)
